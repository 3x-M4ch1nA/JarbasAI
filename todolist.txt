General

    Open street map: "How long will it take to get to London by car if I set off at 5pm?"
    General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS): "When is the next train to Newcastle?"
    Baby monitor mode - constant audio feed from 2nd Mycroft unit in baby's room (with beeping alert to main Mycroft if signal is lost)
    Lotto: "Read me today's lottery numbers"
    TV guide: "What science fiction films are on the TV tonight", "None, Darren, you should probably pay for Sky you cheapskate"
    Currency conversion: "What's 150 dollars in pounds?"
    Unit conversion: "What is 20 inches in centimetres?"
    Recipes "Okay, done that, what's the next step?"
    Read me a story - e.g. an audiobooks, e.g. from project Guttenberg or smashwords. If you don't like the computerised voice reading to you, I believe there librevox for pre-recorded stories too.
    Dictation mode i.e. write down what I say to a document until I give the keyword to stop
    Read IRC conversations outloud on a given channel - use festival or something to provide a different voice to each username (using the smae ones each time so you associate a certain voice with a certain username)
    Facebook/twitter/steam integration - "You have a new facebook notification" or "a game on your Steam wishlist is on sale"

With Camera Module

    Security - I'm on holiday for the next week, so email me if movement is detected in my house ("show me" too if also have phone integration)

With Ubuntu phone integration

    Spoken to Mycroft base unit, but using an Ubuntu phone with Mycroft companion app on it:
        SMS: "Send the following text to dad from my phone ..."
        Shopping list: "Add milk to shopping list" (companion app can then display the full list on demand for when at shop. Maybe have one-offs and weekly shopping lists, too)
        Essential (for me): "Mycroft, Find my phone" (makes phone ring until I find it).
        File transfer: "Send this boarding pass pdf to my phone"
    Spoken to phone directly:
        Audio link to Mycroft unit based at home via WebRTC, so can call home fro free from abroad
        stream music from home network to my phone
        Print this out at home (assuming theres a mycroft base unit and a printer on the same network at "home")
