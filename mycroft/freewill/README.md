- makes an action based on context and neurotransmitters
- listens to a bunch of signals to affect neurotransmitters (TODO get all info from context manager)

Requires

        objectives skill

Recommends

        vision service
        sentiment analisys skill
        leaks service

        lots of skills to use in objectives


Neutransmitters affected by:

        - Number of users in sight
        - Is user smiling
        - Time left alone
        - Number of users interacting on chat
        - Actions taken/ Orders received
        - Sentiment Analisys of Internal toughts (entropy from interactions)
        - Number of leaks found

Neurotransmitters are based on the rough guidelines:

        - dopamine = reward hormone
        - serotonine = happyness hormone
        - tiredness = work hormone
