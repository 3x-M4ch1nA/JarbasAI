now shred of flesh gnawed to the bone  ,
 beware the mark of the beast!  ,
 i am embraced by the cosmic force of night.  ,
 open seven gates  ,
 chanting to the bringer of sin  ,
 take my offer to you king of all kings  ,
 with pride i stand under your sign  ,
 unholy kingdom ruled by death  ,
 blood and flesh we shed with might.  ,
 behold evil desire!  ,
 a long time ago  ,
 i will breathe my fire towards the cosmic eye.  ,
 fallen from heaven rebel of angels  ,
