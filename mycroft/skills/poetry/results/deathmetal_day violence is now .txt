day violence is now a way of life  ,
 from the filth of mankind it now feeds  ,
 involuntarily pulpifying facial regions  ,
 somehow i don't feel the same  ,
 arm yourself with the right to kill at will  ,
 he is hater of the rotten earth  ,
 the horizon will be open for me  ,
 horrifying hell  ,
 lifeless torso gangraped and gutted  ,
 draped in disease  ,
 i cut off its tail and shove it up my ass  ,
 we'll see if you can cut me up  ,
