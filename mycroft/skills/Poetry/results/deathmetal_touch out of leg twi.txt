touch out of leg twitching  ,
 catch you comin out your motherfuckin house  ,
 take the pain - or your life's fuckin' through  ,
 spectral glimmer of glacial snow  ,
 sheltered from the storm  ,
 lost in the vortex he is gone no blessing underway  ,
 unknown ending  ,
 we'll bread and burn and murder  ,
 mesmerizing strength  ,
 the mind of an animal  ,
 betrayal and deceit  ,
 embalmed in blood and unaware  ,
 a call upon death, death answers quickly  ,
 and in us they shall return  ,
 yet not the only one  ,
 slit your throat - deep  ,
 i don't know  ,
 the curse is broken  ,
