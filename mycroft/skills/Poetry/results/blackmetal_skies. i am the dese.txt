skies. i am the desert of redemption  ,
 roll the drums in satans name  ,
 for you to feel my presence at night.  ,
 rise... satans sons  ,
 so pure... evil, cold  ,
 like eternal darkness... in the name of satan  ,
 i renounce the god of the christian faith  ,
 i am lord satan, i am your king.  ,
 oh, hate living...the only heat is warm blood  ,
 thunder bolts in the skies of fire burning heavens's realm of gold,  ,
 moon and stars of night i shall worship thee  ,
 speak to me master, teach me your secrets  ,
 black mass rules tonight  ,
