cat you will fear thee  ,
 all that you took,  ,
 will quench this dead body's thirst  ,
 i feel it run  ,
 bones and skulls of sons and daughters  ,
 in their hearts, oh they carry fear  ,
 i put the gat to your face and head and blast  ,
 i came blood inside of her  ,
 with the guts i've extracted  ,
 parasite breath  ,
