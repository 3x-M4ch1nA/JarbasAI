Claim of love, where is your fruit?,
No posessions or positions, but the heart of you,
Where is your time? Or your listening ear?,
Would you take the time you hold so dear?,
Busyness seems to pull you away,
Can you even concentrate on the words that I say?,
Missing the meaning, flying over your head,
Slow down your mind and your heart gets fed,
Oh, how I wish your eyes could see,
That your ears could hear the heart of me,
That peace is there, you must face the truth,
You will feel the pain, but this is what you must do,
The minute you slow down, your heart will see,
Less of yourself, and more of me,

youthful romance began with a kiss
concluded in a lifetime of bliss

love,life-long,ever-lasting
in moments,so tender tasting

not for a second do I regret my choice
in my ear day,she whispers love's voice

Sorry i feel shame
on my act which i done
please forgive me
i beg your pardone
it was done by mistake
i didn't do it willfully
in future of life
i will consider it carefully
this is my first mistake
now i am fully awake
don't leave me alone
my life is about to gone
there is no any specific reason
let's go it's a love season

Joyfulness created in glorious morn
A love more than love was born;
Looked like it was to be a perfect day
Forgetting that I had a ransom to pay

Forgotten, unseen and ignored by my weary eyes
Only I know how to stare at the unpredictable skies;
My deliverance had to be appropriately procured
A broken embrace to the one I loved had to be endured.

I had no emotions and no love to provide
I knew immediately my heart had died.

As I returned home tired of the day's work,
my son, with a greeting smile, came running to me.
As usual, I kissed him and said, "I love you, my son".
"What is love, Papa?" quite innocently he asked.
Giving him a chocolate, I simply said,
"This is my love for you".
The innocent question stirred my soul
and all my thoughts fell on the 'simple' word 'LOVE',
"What is love? Where is love?"
Love is there, I thought, in our care
that we give to our kids and in our desire
to see them grow before our eyes.
Love is seen in the heart of a mother
who has to part her children from her
and send them to distant lands
to win the race of life.
Love is seen in the worries of a wife
who waits for the safe return of her husband.
Love is there in a true friend
who works as an inspiration,
stands by in all thick and thin
and shares all joys and sorrows.
Love is seen, by a lover, in the beginning
of a smile-love-a composition of
 a single soul living in two bodies.
So pleased I felt to imagine
that love is everywhere
and 'all is well with the world'.
Relaxing on my chair, I picked the newspaper
with a desire to know something good of the world.
and again asked myself, "Where is love?"
who proclaimed, "Where there is love, there is life".

Very deep inside of me,
So many pictures,
so many memories,
For you’re the one to hold the key
To unlock the songs and melodies.

All the yesterdays of sunset,
The rays of sun not gone away,
But reappear at dawn to stay,
And echo lyrics of the day,

Then my  footstep trod to find,
The love of time I left behind,
The voice which whispered in my ear,
Just taste my breath for I am near,

All the yesterdays of sunset,
The rays of sun not gone away,
The voice which whispered in my ear,
Just taste my breath for I am near,

My dear, my dear.
My love, My love.
Why do you fear?
The night is longer than I knew.
Stay, soon the sun will bring the day.
I must go, it continues to be dark.
It won’t forever be night.
I can’t see the stars.
Even so, you can be my light.
I will darken the day to night.
Wait, don’t let the world fill you with hate.
I have no defense.
My dear, my dear.
My love, my love.
You have nothing to fear.
There is nothing left.
Trust, never lose hope is a must.
Hope has been stolen away in the light.
It won’t always be this way
I am trapped in this darkness.
Soon there will be a better day
There will only be darker times
Look, a good ending will come as in your fairytale book
I see no happy ending in sight
My dear, my dear.
My love, my love.
There is no need for fear.
Only because of accepting the dark.
Do not invite the dark
It will make me stronger.
Continue to sing as a lark
I stopped long ago.
Hope, there will always be a way to cope
Hope left me when I was young
My dear, my dear.
My love, my love.
What is it you fear?
I fear nothing.
Do not try to show me lies
I show you wisdom in the dark.
Why do you think yourself wise
Dark has revealed what light was hiding.
Hush, you can’t keep hiding in the brush
I don’t need to hide, but you?
My dear, my dear.
You are not in the cover of darkness.
You are one I will never fear.
Then you can’t say you are wise.
You won’t listen as I say
I don’t need you now or ever.
You are becoming darker this way
I was always dark, you were blind
Why do you destroy all I can do is cry
You can do nothing anymore.
My dear, my dear.
My love, my love.
You are the dove,
Claiming wisdom and light,
You gave into me without any fight.
“My dear,” you call and think I fear.
But I am the crow,
Strong in the night,
Flying higher, Stronger, forever in flight.
While you give in to rest in the night.
You tried to be the light,
But I am the dark,
And I have broken all the world,
And with the world, I destroyed you,
And destroying you,
Destroyed me.

For your eyes only
I give to you
The words that I can't speak
Yet each one is true

From somewhere within
This timeframe of life
You came along
And fit in just right

You make all the mundane
Not seem so bad
You're an uplifting spirit
Whenever I'm sad

There's an attraction down deep
That I can't describe
Leaving my words all bundled
And my mouth tongue-tied

When we met in this life
It had to be fate
Cause we formed a bond
That never will break

My words lack the feeling
My heart knows you deserve
Most writings come easy
But I'm at a loss for all words

I'm sure it's not chance
That brought you to me
Each time that you're near
An Angel I see

Your like Christmas morning
When I was five
My excitement abounding
You make me feel so alive

You deserve so much more
Than my words can express

Your eyes spoke to me,
told me things that my heart did not yet see
Visions of love that would be;
if I chose to let go of the past,
and embrace discovering this new mystery
that stands tantalizingly before me
You are the embodiment of the secret desires
circulating in my dreams
Offering your smile as a loving balm
to heal ne from the pain of past rejection ...
then face a new voice with openness of mind
These emerald eyes that speak low to me,
has such a gentle, soothing voice
An earthy sound rooted down to the ground,
reviving my forlorn heart
I am touched in my mind
by the thoughts you share with your inviting eyes
Such calm and reassuring hope,
the words from your eyes have infused in me
Your eyes spoke with pure sincerity,
and abiding honesty of where love will lead
You have seen the future of our destiny,
and spoke with the sight of faith
of a love you've seen not yet given from me
But soon one day will be given freely
And when this love within me
flows into the reservoir of your heart
My eyes will then speak
joyful words to you: til death do us part

You stride into my messy life,
And decided to be its part…
You show me what it feels like,
To be "the one" inside your heart…

“It feels so great,
And I’m so delight,
That someone like you,
Is sparkling into my life…”

I know I’m not worthy of this,
But you are taking some risk…
I don’t know how long or until when,
But I hope this love will never end...

Yet, show me in love, with meaning and purpose,
Humble my heart, feelings aside,
Let me see with your beautiful eyes,
When I don't understand, give me patience to wait,
Let your words of love rule what I do and say,
Help me not to make assumptions,
Give me your heart in this all,
The seat of my emotions, I hand to you,
Let them match in your love through all I say and do,

IF fire lights Hearts
IF fire ignites starts
IF fire starts all Love
then by love i shall
burn all the world
within my love!
  Love is not of Men
and Love is not of
those fair maidens
called women
  But by the gods;
that, if by gods must
be men it is women
that speaks slowly
and clearly ... i say,

"if by any breathing
love then by beautiful
rose and if by rains
then by blue skies!"

--that of humanity!
by such was a poet
unknown we agreed:
~:solving the depths
of both sadness and
happiness we fall
between those two
the architecture
of emotional physics!

3000 times… or more…
much more, my love,
I have gazed at your nakedness
with lustful adoration

3000 times… or more…
I have kissed your sweet breasts,
drawn to your flesh,
craving your amorous embrace

3000 times… or more…
much more…
I have stroked you to ecstasy,
the sight and sound of your delight
driving my desire

3000 times... or more…
lying between your silken limbs,
I have entered a carnal paradise,
our bodies entwined
in intimate abandon

3000 times… or more…
I have held you,
my lips on your lips,
my body deep in yours…
and wanting to stay there forever

3000 times… or more…
we have come together,
my ardour bursting inside you,
our juices mingling
in blissful union

Such delicious couplings of
devotion and desire.
May they continue…
till the end of our days, my love.
