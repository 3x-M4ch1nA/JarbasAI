cold hail satan king of kings  ,
 call the ones as i chant  ,
 death i seek in solitary as i begin to hear the voices of melancholic doom.  ,
 we are the killers in search of christ  ,
 beautiful evil self to be the morbid count  ,
 members of infernal worship gather in the night,  ,
 i call upon your forces  ,
 i bow before thee  ,
 army of christians...  ,
 i worship for my pagan journey.  ,
 hiding in the veil of black  ,
 loyal i shall be...  ,
 black ritual knife in my hand held up high.  ,
 those are the ways of survival for existence of the wolven breed.  ,
 grieving in pain i slowly bleed as i caress wounds in my flesh.  ,
 a fire burns... within our forest... the blood is thick... and only black  ,
 hail... lucifer  ,
