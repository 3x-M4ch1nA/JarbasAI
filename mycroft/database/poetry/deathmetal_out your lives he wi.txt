out your lives he will take  ,
 he is bringing death  ,
 rid us the disease of mankind  ,
 squirting my sperm allover the mess  ,
 in storm i stand upon the ruins  ,
 so perfect  ,
 death we're seeking for  ,
 we're rising from the grave  ,
 no one will discover the murder they commit  ,
 it's something i believe in  ,
 breeding death  ,
 none can stop the rising  ,
 suffer, and then you die  ,
