pray in their hearts, oh they carry fear  
 one of them ripped off all my clothes  
 not one has survived - my torture and abuse  
 we just want the truth  
 grim and frostbitten kingdoms  
 spending my life molesting dead children  
 for this i would battle kingly palaces  
 i have a dependence on vaginal skin  
 the knowing of being beneath  
 from a berg to the open sky  
 playing with her severed tits  
 swollen with liquid  
 it haunts me everyday
